# games-pythonista-ADogsLife
A repository for the game A Dog's Life developed for the iPhone in Pythonista, based on the Scene module.  

In the game you are playing the character of a dog chasing a wolf on a forest meadow. You move the dog with the help of the iPhone's built-in accelerometer and gyroscope.

The game is at a beta stage and is being continously improved. A future version will include sheep, with the dog's aim being to protect these from the wolf.
